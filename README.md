# EXPERIMENT 1

## TEMPORAL FRAME ORDER
* First frame : White background with black fixation point in center of window. Use parameters as used below. Duration [500 ms]

* Second frame : White background with non-informative stimulus => red/green circle with radius a bit larger than fixation point. Center of screen. Duration [850 ms]

* Third frame : Same first frame for 500 ms

* Fourth frame : Black fixation point in the center. Two colored circles (red/green) on either side of the point with centeres lying on the same line as that of the fixation point. Mix the spatial order of the stimuli (if performing TOJ). We can test if participant registers the non-informative stimuli by doing a variant of this. Call to discuss


## USER ACTIVITY
* On fourth frame, ask user to perform simultaneity judgement task (SJ) or temporal order judgement task (TOJ).

* Recommended => SJ task as it reduces response bias. Call me to discuss this detail

* Hypothesis : Attention will be directed to the stimulus primed by the non-informative stimulus prior


# EXPERIMENT 2

* Expt 1 with Images as prior


## Other details

* Temporal study for immediate, post 2 minutes, post 5 minutes effect after prime given. Study trend as temporal delay is extended
* Within group study followed
* Two types of participants :
  * Trial group : Subliminal prime presented
  * Control group : ~15% participants where non-informative stimuli not presented
